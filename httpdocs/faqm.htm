<p><font color="#990000">Q: Where can I get gems?</font>
<br>A: Each zone has a max_gem variable. If it is above 0, you can get
gems. Newbie zones and University are
<br>only zones so far that DON'T drop gems.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Where can I get Shadow Items?</font>
<br>A: In any zone with max_gem above **. Check the help site for details.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: What is the chance to get a drop? Why didn't
I get a drop for xxx levels?</font>
<br>A: The chance to get a gem is around 0.003 after you kill a monster.
The chance to get a Shadow item is
<br>around 0.00025. However, it is totally random, and you can go
300 levels without finding anything or
<br>get 5 gems within 10 minutes. Chalice of Luck increases the chances
to 0.006 and 0.0005.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How is chance to hit determined? What about
spells?</font>
<br>A: Chance to hit is dependant on Dex and weapon mastery. Chance to
cast relies on Wis and spell mastery.
<br>100% mastery means double Dex or Wis. To be able to hit every time,
you need to have your modified Dex
<br>or Wis two times higher than that of the enemy. Monsters have 1% mastery.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: What about who attacks first?</font>
<br>A: Your modified stat (Dex or Wis) is checked against the highest enemy
stat (Dex or Wis). Highest attacks first.
<br>There is a small (20%) random involved too, so you need a bit higher
than enemy to attack first. Masteries
<br>don't affect attack order.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: What is monster Dex/Wis then?</font>
<br>A: Monsters have all stats equal. This means they have the same amount
of life, Dex, Wis, Str and Ntl.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: So how much damage do I make?</font>
<br>A: Damage is dependant on your weapon/spell, enemy armor and your strength/intelligence.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How do I know enemy armor/weapon/spell class?</font>
<br>A: You don't. Just try to fight the enemy and see if you can kill it.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: In which order gems work?</font>
<br>A: Right hand gem 1, left hand gem 1, armor g1, spell1 g1, spell2 g1,
right hand g2, left hand g2, etc.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Which hand attacks first?</font>
<br>A: The right hand.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can gems kill?</font>
<br>A: No.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can gems be removed from item?</font>
<br>A: Yes :) Check the manual.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: What is battle order?</font>
<br>A: 1.enemy gems 2. your gems 3. calculate chance to hit/cast 4. your
accessory 5. enemy accessory 6. combat.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: What do masteries do exactly? How do I raise
them?</font>
<br>A: Masteries affect chance to hit and chance to make critical damage.
They are raised randomly after a successful
<br>hit, and each 1% is harder to raise. Each race has certain maximal
mastery values.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How much gold can I carry?</font>
<br>A: (2^32)-1 gold in bank and same amount on hand. That is exactly 4294967295,
or around 4 billion.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: What is max level? Max stats? Max damage?</font>
<br>A: Max stats and damage are theoretically 4294967295, however max level
now is 65535, so max stats
<br>would be 6550k. There is no limit to modified stats.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Do Mystic Item effects come before or after
gems?</font>
<br>A: Before gems.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Are their "magic spots" ie places that have
higher drop rates?</font>
<br>A: The Lair of Temptation zone, found at 5,4 in Demon Gate and level
200 to enter has a double chance to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop Shadow items, but only * gems are found
there.
