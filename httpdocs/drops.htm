<title>Drops @ 2006-10-18</title>

<h2>Drops</h2>
<li>First of all, drops are based purely on luck.</i>
<li>Second, there is a distinction between TB and normal, as TB has to rely on drops for sufficient funds.</li>
<li>Third, these rates are subject to change, but are the rates used at the time of writing, 2006-10-18.</li>
<li>Fourth, below follows some VERY basic math. If you don't understand it, breath and read it again.</li>
<hr color="red">
The factor for turn based chars is, at this moment, 2.5. This means that if a droprate is 1/250 for normal's, it boils down to 
1/100 for TB's. This factor is set to 1 for non turn based chars.<br>
The system is cascading, you can't get multiple drops. If one drop is chosen by luck, the chain is over. Some drops however are an exception to this. 
This waterfall is reflected in the numbers below, 1) is the first drop you can have, 2) the second and so on.<br>
<br>
1) Purse-drop<br>
-> what: you get gold<br>
-> who: all<br>
-> chance: 1/(5000/factor)<br>
<br>
2) Gem-drop<br>
-> what: you get gems, different for TB/normal<br>
-> who: all<br>
-> chance: 3+bonus/(1500/factor)<br>
* bonus from clan, accessory<br>
<br>
3) Shadow-drop<br>
-> what: you get items, different for TB/normal<br>
-> who: all<br>
-> chance: 3+bonus/(15000/factor)<br>
* bonus from clan, accessory<br>
3a) Accessory-drop<br>
IF you get a shadow drop, there is a very tiny chance it'll be an accessory.<br>
<br>
4a) Gem-mine IF you're in a clan AND tax > 4%<br>
-> what: you get gems<br>
-> who: all<br>
-> chance: 1/(2500/factor)<br>
* Mined gems are always random for Turn Based chars!<br>
4b) Turns-drop IF you're Turn Based AND you're not in a clan OR you're in clan with tax < 5%<br>
-> what: you get turns<br>
-> who: turn based<br>
-> chance: 1/(2500)<br>
<i>Note on 4): if you're turn based and not in a clan, you can get turns. If you're in a clan, the tax will define whether you get turns or gems: 5% or higher will yield gems, the other case turns.<br>
If you're a normal player, you can't get turns. You will only get gems if the tax is at least 5%.</i>
<br>

I sincerely hope this will at least shed some light on the entire drop thing.<br>
Once again, if you don't get it, read it again. If you ask me questions, I'll just point you to this page.<br>
