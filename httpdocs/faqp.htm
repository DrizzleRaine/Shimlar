<br><b><i>This info is only for programmers or those that want to make
a game of their own.</i></b></center>

<p><font color="#990000">Q: How did you make the game?</font>
<br>A: I made the game using PHP language for server side processes, a MySQL
database, and JavaScript, DHTML and HTML
<br>for the client side interface.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Do you have to be a smartass to make a game?</font>
<br>A: No, you need some programming knowledge, a lot of determination
and good logic. Also preferrably
<br>a good understanding of math, arrays and database systems.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How long did it take to make the game?</font>
<br>A: The original Alpha version was made in 2 weeks with around 6h work
a day.
<br>However, the current version is a result of well over 2000 hours of
work.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How much does it cost to run the game?</font>
<br>A: We are on a dedicated server that has no CPU limits and costs 129$
a month
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How big is the source code?</font>
<br>A: The source code is split into many files (approximately 200 files).
<br>The size of the interface file is around 89kb
<br>The size of all the PHP files together is around 150kb
<br>The size of all the update JavaScript files together is around 10kb
<br>There are also various "extra" files in php, htm and js that take about
100kb.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can you give me the URL where you can make
games like this?</font>
<br>A: No, since there is no such place. A good start would be learning
JavaScript, then visiting the <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP Web site</a> and 
the <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL Web site </a>
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Where can I learn Java and Php?</font>
<br>A: There are loads of sites on the net, and books in shops.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: I know HTML, can I make a game like this?</font>
<br>A: Probably no, you need to learn a real programming language, like
C++, VB or Perl to understand all the stuff.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How do I make a login page?</font>
<br>A: If you know CGI, ASP or PHP, just make a form and process the input.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How do I get a database?</font>
<br>A: Most web hosting companies support a database of some sorts. However,
free ones usually don't or limit access to it.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: But you made this on a free server?</font>
<br>A: Yes, the f2s hosting company had a database and php support, but
they don't offer free web space anymore.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can I use your source code?</font>
<br>A: The JavaScript files can be downloaded by anyone. If you don't know
how, do not ask me. If you do, you can
<br>use them, as I have no way of preventing you from doing so. You should
not be able to access the php source,
<br>and if you do manage to do so, it is illegal to use it for commercial
or hacking purposes.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can the game be hacked?</font>
<br>A: Yes, anything can be hacked but there are consequences when (not if) you 
get caught.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can You hack?</font>
<br>A: I prefer to use my skills for legal purposes, but I guess any web
programmer can hack something.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: How much bandwidth and space does the game
take?</font>
<br>A: Currently, the game source files take up about 350kb, all the manuals,
pictures and html files take up about
<br>600 kb, the database takes up a total of 15Mb (around 10Mb active data).
That's for 10,000 players
<br>We are now using around 120Mb of bandwidth a day (with the 150 players
online).
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Does the game have bugs?</font>
<br>A: Yes, every complex game has bugs but there are less and less everyday.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Do you get paid to make the game? Do you spend
all your free time on the game?</font>
<br>A: No, I don't get paid to make the game, and I spend about 80% of
my free time on it.
<br>The game is not my way of making a living either.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can you send me the game source?</font>
<br>A: No. I could help somebody with game problems if
you are making a game, but it is better
<br>that you start yourself.
