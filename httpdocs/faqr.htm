<p><font color="#990000">Q: What is reset?</font>
<br>A: A player wipe. All Characters, items and such are deleted. These only 
occur when a serious bug in the game is found and has been exploited by many 
people. We don't currently anticipate any further resets for this reason, 
though.<p><font color="#990000">Q: Do I keep my items?</font>
<br>A: No.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: When?</font>
<br>A: Whenever it's needed, but as seldom as possible.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: So, I lose everything. All my xxx hours of
playtime and no result?</font>
<br>A: It's a game... a waste of time anyways :)
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Do mods keep their powers? RP mods? Arches?</font>
<br>A: Mods and RP mods will have a choice to keep power or not. Arches
will have a choice of mod or player.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Will there be a warning before reset?</font>
<br>A: No, it's pointless since people will stop playing.
<p><font color="#990000">Q: Can I go and pk everyone now? Or shout bad
words?</font>
<br>A: No. The game is still running, and a lot of features are not done.
Bad behavior will get you muted or banned.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banned characters will not be able to reserve names.
