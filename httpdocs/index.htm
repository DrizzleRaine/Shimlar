<i>This is the end<br>
Beautiful friend<br>
This is the end<br>
My only friend, the end<br>
<br>
Of our elaborate plans, the end<br>
Of everything that stands, the end<br>
No safety or surprise, the end<br>
I'll never look into your eyes...again</i><br><br>

	Hi,<br><br>
	for some of you, this is the second time they see such a white page instead of the usual black one. For others, 
	it's the first time. Don't feel bad about it :) The message is the same.<br>
	You can continue reading, <b><a href="_index.htm" target="_self">or click here to fast forward to the game</a></b>.<br>
	Just FYI: the policies inside the game don't change. We can still mute and/or ban.<br>
	You might have noticed I didn't answer emails anymore. I stopped doing so on 22/06/2007. You probably wonder why? Well. I don't know.
	I just felt like... this is it. It's the end. I signed my contract as lawyer, and I knew I needed to free more time for work. Stopping with the email was one step.<br>
	Other reasons influenced my decision as well.<br>
	<ul>
		<li>I kept banning cheaters.</li>
		<li>Financial support... I coded some new things, nothing changed. Ok, no one wants to pay anymore.</li>
		<li>Some people think they control it all... well, it's not true as you can see.</li>
		<li>The game is now 6 years old. It would need a major overhaul, as technology largely passed us.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	What will happen now? Mmmmm... I remember how I felt when RaceWarKingdoms, the original, true and free version, closed. 
	Clerity wrote a beautiful poem about it. It was a very very very sad day... but also the start of Shimlar. Since then, 
	many other people started creating games. Toshax and I influenced a lot of people. And so did the many others who
	participated here. All the archwizards, all the moderators, all the players, and, last but not least, those who passed away.<br>
	I do hope that playing in a community like Shimlar formed parts of you in a good way. We at least tried to keep it a friendly place to play.<br><br>
	To return to my point. RWK literally was removed from the server, entirely, without warning whatsoever. I now warn thee.<br>
	The contract with the provider ends on 08/11/2007. That's the eight of november. The server will be shut down at <b>6 P.M. CST (GMT -6)</b>. You can convert it to your timezone <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html" target="_blank">by clicking here</a>.<br><br>
	What will happen? I'll keep a copy of the code and the database for myself. Who knows what might happen in the future. Please <b>do not</b> ask me for
	(pieces of) the code. It's not open source. It never was. It's not meant to be shared.<br><br>
	Once again, I would like to sincerely thank all those who <a href="http://www.shimlar.com/donate/" target="_blank">contributed to the game's existence the past six years</a>. 
	Please do not donate anymore, it won't change my mind. Also, many thanks to all those who were my eyes, ears and opinion in the game the last six years. I can't be online all the time, it never would have run until now without the mods and archwizards.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you all for being part of my life. I'm 30 since 25/10/2007, and I have to move on with my personal life as I did professionally. I hope
	you'll find another new home as I did when RWK shut down. I wish ye all the very very best in life.<br>

To show a bit of the Shimlar offspring, I'll mention some games. Remember, we do not endorse or support any of these games.<br>
They're simply here because... I can mention them.<br>
