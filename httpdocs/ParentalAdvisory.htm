            <P align=left>Shimlar is a game that allows players to 
            communicate with each other. As stated in the <A 
            href="/TermsOfUse.htm" target=_blank>Terms of 
            Use</A> the moderators or the administrators cannot guarantee that the things said or 
            information linked to by other players of the game will be suitable 
            for all ages. Shimlar offers tools such as the /ignore 
            feature and the ability to contact moderators in order to 
            allow players to shelter themselves from possibly offensive 
            material.<BR><BR>Shimlars' player to player communication 
            is all server based. This means that messages are never sent 
            directly between players' computers but rather through our servers 
            in order to protect your privacy. Other common chatting programs 
            often allow messages to be sent directly between users allowing them 
            to gain knowledge of your IP address which can be used to determine 
            private information such as your location or as a gateway to attempt 
            to hijack your computer. <br><br>Sharing real life details in online games is dangerous.
            You never know who is talking to you, even when you think you know the person.
            Therefore, you should not share real life details like your name, your location or other personal data with people you don't know in person.<br><br>
            USING SHIMLAR.ORG FOR DATING OR APPOINTMENTS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.<br><br>
            IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT PLAYERS DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER PLAYERS OUTSIDE OF SHIMLAR TO ENSURE THEIR PRIVACY AND SAFETY. </P></TD>
