  	  	<b><font color="#FFFFFF">18.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	So, after a week my note on the donations page has been discovered. More or less proves my point. Nevertheless.<br>
  	No matter what, the game WILL stay online at least until it's 5th anniversary.<br>
  	Meanwhile, I might give it a major overhaul to disencourage macros. While I can beat them, it only harms legit players as was pointed out rather frequently the last two weeks.<br>
  	So, I do have an idea on the change I want, but I'm first scanning for opinions. Once I know whether or not people like it, I'll code it pretty soon as not much has to be changed.<br>
  	A decision I will only make after the 5th anniversary of Shimlar.
  <br>
  	<b><font color="#FFFFFF">11.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Reversed some of yesterday's updates due to various complaints.<br>
  	Deleted the list of reserved names.
  <br>
    <b><font color="#FFFFFF">10.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Released interface version 24.<br>
  	To copy a line, you can select it with the mouse and then drag it to the box where you type your text.
  <br>
  	<b><font color="#FFFFFF">07.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Fixed bug where clan chat was visible due to a smallint(3) in the database (thx Rostaman & hennessy).
  <br>
    <b><font color="#FFFFFF">06.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Fixed bug that still shows players on your IP (thx destroyer432).<br>
  	Added as much as I could from Shimlar's history in the link above.
  <br>
  	<b><font color="#FFFFFF">02.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Thanks for your financial support Lord Boma, Wheeltapper, 828809 and Lady Gemini!!<br>

  	Fixed Chat Only version of the game (thx Magdelana).
  <br>
  	<b><font color="#FFFFFF">01.August 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Fixed bug in buddylist.<br>
  	Fixed bug in reservation where login was re-usable, thus preventing reserved chars to reregister (thx Mistress Maigu).<br>
  	<b><font color="red">PM's are invisible for ALL and are deleted from the database after they're read.</font></b>
  <br>
  	<b><font color="#FFFFFF">30.July 2006</font></b>
  <br>
  	Due to the massive amount of email I received while on vacation, I decided to <b><font color="red">reset</font></b> rather then *repair*.<br>
  	What's new?<br>
  	<b>- ALL current names are reserved.</b> If you want your current name back, register with the SAME PASSWORD AND USERNAME.<br>
  	If you shared your login details, I suggest to change the password afterwards.<br>
  	- Mods and Archwizards are set up automatically upon reregistering.<br>
  	- Renames will only happen for a valid reason, not because you don't like your name anymore.<br>
  	- Sharing equipment is 100% (which means fully and completely) YOUR responsibility. If your pooling partner (of their friend's neighbour paperboy) is banned with your equipment, it's YOUR problem.<br>
  	- You can no longer pk people on your IP.<br>
  	- Randomised bank options.<br>
  	- Font size is moved to a cookie, I hope it'll work in the entire game now.<br>
  	- Released version 23 of the interface, so clean your temp files!!<br>
  	<br>
  	And yes, holiday was fine (but very warm). For all who remember him: Odessa passes his greetings!<br>
  	<i>Fixed some minor bugs related to the new code and the reset.</i>

  /setign $name: $lvl allows a mod to set the ignore level for a certain player to the level (s)he desires.<br>
  Watch the syntax carefully: /setign <space> $name<colon> <space> $lvl, with $name the name of the player and $lvl the desired level.<br>
  It also disables the ability of a player to send equipment, this means /uncheck $name might be needed if the players is ok.

  	Ints are numbers, and they can be searched faster then strings.  Everbody now has a number (int) AND a name (string) in the database.  We can now use the numbers to look up stuff in the database.<br>

   I've been working on this one since last reset, adding the int's we forgot three years ago when making the game.<br>

   Two bugs *could* be fixed (I didn't check, just fixed some weird code): flags in kd's and inventory items-scramble after a transfer.<br>
   More then <b>100</b> files with code have been updated. This means that there is quite a chance that errors and/or bugs will occur.<br>
   If you see ANY weird behaviour, contact me please.  Describe the problem as good as possible.  Failure to do so and abuse of errors might lead to a ban, or even a reset.  And rest assured: your name will be mentioned if that occurs :)

<br>Lord Arpharazon is now known as Burzum.
<br>Toshax has college classes again and will be busy for a while, so will not 
be able to chat with you all that much.
<br>ShadowMouse Software Ltd. is working on a new project, so Shimlar won't have any 
updates or new ideas implemented for 3 months.  Errors will get fixed tough.
<br>Please remember that the game is free, and the admins run it for you to enjoy, 
let them have their space also.<br><b><font color="#FFFFFF">07.January.2003</font></b>
<br>It has become apparent that the game community has become corrupt with
favoritism, bribe, blackmail and cheating.
<br>To make the game enjoyable for everyone again, players should be reminded
of the following:
<br><font color="#00CC00">-Mod means moderator, it is a job, not a bonus.
You do not play to become a mod, mods are chosen to moderate chat, and
this power is not given to friends, but to people who show the skills.
There are probably usualy enough mods, so don't ask to become one.</font>
<br><font color="#00CC00">-Arches, or archwizards, are people who have either
skills that are needed to run the game, like php, mysql, linux knowledge,
time to read emails, etc. Yet again this is a job, and the chance of any
players to become arch are 0%. You do not "promote" from mod to arch after a while neither.</font>
<br><font color="#00CC00">-Any sort of macroing, scripting, or automation
is illegal. No, you are NOT alowed to run a macro while you are eating
or because you have a slow connection. Punishment for macroing is ban,
no restoring.</font>
<br><font color="#00CC00">-Being friends with game admins or arches does
not make you any special. You are friends with the person behind the admin,
not the admin himself. Admins are humans too, and can make mistakes. Trying
to charm or bribe admins into giving any sort of help will not be tolerated.</font>
<br><font color="#00CC00">-The game should be a fair competition to all,
and it has it's risks. PK is part of the game, so is losing items to popper.
You either like it and play, or don't play.</font>
<br><b>Bottom line: everyone has an equal chance to compete, nobody gets
levels, gold, items, masteries or mod powers because they are friends with
admins, or have cash. Also, no spamming chat or harrassing other players
even if you are mod (alternative names will be IP traced).</b>
