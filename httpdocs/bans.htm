	<body>
		Hi,<br>
		I'm sure quite a few of you have questions around what happened lately with Got Milk? and Armageddon.<br>
		In case you didn't notice, both clans had all the clan members banned and the clan deleted.<br>
		<p>
			<i>The punishment</i><br>
			Is this harsh? Not as far as I'm concerned.<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Only members are banned.</li>
				<li>Only the chars are banned, the IP is still free which means they can still play</li>
				<li>I did <b>not</b> ban mules of clan members</li>
			</ul>					
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>How to avoid</i><br>
			Well that's an easy one. Make sure you join people you <b>trust</b> to play legit. No one forces you to join a clan.<br>
			Also, these bans are not used daily. Standard procedure is still a normal macro check, resulting in a ban if you don't answer or when your script doesn't handle it properly.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Can't you...</i><br>
			No I can't. In fact, I could. But I don't feel like. I use this punishment as macroers gain<br>
			- gold<br>
			- items<br>
			- levels<br>
			resulting in more money, more items and a stronger clan for all. So I do <b>not</b> trace items or gold to wipe these or some of them. I remove the clan.
		</p>

			<i>What happened to Got Milk??</i><br>
			Apart from many accusations that their members do macro... I bumped upon <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=48893" target="_blank">this link</a> on the AutoIt forums. I quickly found out the player was Trivium.<br>
			Keeping in mind the input from other players and mods about Got Milk? (thanks for that by the way), I decided to check some more. Noticing that I was told some time ago that the latest AutoIt script did handle the random pm's (<b>note</b>: I <b>ONLY</b> ban when caught... not for other reasons!!), I started modifying stuff in the database.<br>
			Rather quickly, I decided that there was circumstantial evidence that showed practically the whole clan scripted. So I booted them.<br>
			Trivium mailed me to know what happened, I told him he scripted. He <b>blatantly</b> denied it. Until I showed him the link, he didn't answer after that.<br>
			I was furious. I can stand some, but when caught be a real man and admit it. Don't deny. There are life forms living in the dirt that get more respect from me than people like Trivium. I guess I should create the gender "twat" just for him.<br>
			<br>
			<i>What happened to Armageddon?</i><br>
			Today I saw <a href="http://www.autoitscript.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=49132" target="_blank">this link</a> on the AutoIt forum.<br>
			I wonder when the poster was lobotomized, but it was frankly spoken rather easy to trace him... Not to mention he mailed me earlier he was glad Got Milk? got banned but stating explicit he for sure did not macro.<br>
			Again, lies. He obviously did. I'm well aware of the impact this has. Player <b>Bitemeharder</b> for example is, as far as I can see, innocent and most likely did not know what Lord Skeletor was doing. Yet he's banned as well for the reasons above: gold, items, levels from the Clan.<br>
			Lord Skeletor found it necessary to mail me requesting "If you could explain in full detail it would help me clerify as to what happend". Apart from the errors, it's again a blatant denial of own deeds. For people like him, procedures to acknowledge children exist. You could put a tail on him and call him a weasel.<br>
			Of course, after reading this text, he found it necessary to mail me again admitting it all. How cute. I'm not easily pleased it seems.
		</p>

			<i>What's next?</i><br>
			I honestly don't know. I've been pondering simply<br>
			- posting the macro here so all can use it<br>
			- remove the toplists so that the use is meaningless<br>
			- change the pk to once an hour so that the impact is less<br>
			Honestly, I wouldn't mind. I could speed up Shimlar a lot by removing all the code used to check. Mods could moderate chat instead of hunting scripters. I could add some more stuff to the game for those who care.<br>
			<br>
			Anyway, I'm quite disappointed in the lack of self-respect amongst some players (if you script, dare to admit it) and the accusations from some players in chat.<br>
			Some of you seem to think I have nothing else to do than count the money from Shimlar. Well, I do have other things to do and the money is used for hosting, not for me.<br>
			<br>
			That's enough rambling for now. I'll answer emails when I feel like doing so.<br>
