  <b>General idea</b><br>
  The general idea of a silent auction is for everyone to bid once on an item and the highest bid is the winner. 
  This lets other people get involved in a auction that they may not win if it was a normal one. 
  These auctions can be risky. Items may be sold for more than what they should be sold for, but on the other 
  hand they can be sold for less as well. There is no outbidding one another, you only get one shot at it.  
  This lets the poorer characters have a chance at winning a item. It is also a new twist on the normal way 
  of bidding. Gives auctioneers a new option. There are a few rules that need to be addressed though.
  <br><br>
  This is a brief and general overview of a silent auction and the key points involved:<br>
  <li>Auctioneer announces that he is holding a silent auction. He/She also posts what the item being 
  bidded on is and an optional minimum bid.</li>
  <li>Everyone that is participating in the auction privately messages (pm's) the auctioneer one and 
  only one bid. The bidders DO NOT post bids in chat. If there is more than one bid by any person, 
  the first bid is noted and the 2nd or more are ignored. Also any bids below a minimum bid set by the 
  auctioneer can be ignored as well.</li>
  <li>The bids are compared by the auctioneer and the highest bid is the winner.  The auctioneer posts 
  ONLY the person who won, the price, and time stamp if needed - so everyone knows that no scamming is 
  involved.</li>

  <b>The Rules</b><br>
  <b>1) </b>It would be courteous for everyone participating if the auctioneer clearly post that the 
  auction is a silent auction and not a normal one. To avoid any confusion.<br>
  <b>2) </b>Everyone bidding on the item sends only one pm bid. If there are two or more bids by one 
  person the first bid is noted and the rest are ignored.<br>
  <b>3) </b>Auctioneer should give a little time for the bids to come in.<br>
  <b>4) </b>Auctioneer compares the bids, the highest bid is the winner. The Auctioneer posts 
  who won, highest price, and time stamp if needed - so everyone can see it, and so everyone knows 
  no scamming is involved.<br>
  <i>(Example: JoeBob won with a high bid of 100k (( 15:32:04 )). Time stamp needed if there are more than 
  2 high bids, the first one to pm the auctioneer wins. Time Stamp is the tie breaker.)</i>
  <b>5) </b>The auctioneer should ignore all bids in chat and also ignore any bids that come in after 
  the auctioneer posts that the auction is closed or after the auctioneer posts who won.<br>
  <b>6) </b>If the highest bid is owned by 2 or more people, the bid that was recieved by the auctioneer 
  first is the winner.  Announce all of the highest bids, with their time stamp so everyone can see.<br> 
  <i>(This is the default way to determine a winner because it is the easiest way. This may change 
  in the future though.)</i><br>
  <i>(Note, the winner can also be determined by another silent auction on the same item by only 
  the highest bidders. The highest bidders put in another silent bid to the auctioneer higher than 
  their previous bids and the new highest bidder wins. This is another method to determine a winner 
  with 2 or more of the same highest bids but the first one is easier and probably the safest way.)</i><br>
  To determine a winner from a silent auction with 2 or more high bids, all the high bidders must agree to 
  the 2nd option. If not all of them agree then the first and default option is the way to determine 
  the winner.<br>
  <b>7) </b>Minimum bids by the auctioneer are optional. If a minimum bid is posted then all 
  bids under that minimum can be ignored. It is up to the auctioneer to decide whether they want 
  to note bids under their posted minimum.  It is suggested that the auctioneer place a minimum bid 
  on their item. If there is no minimum bid, then bidders can pm any bid they choose and it WILL be 
  noted. So if there is no minimum bid set by the auctioneer, he/she runs the risk of selling an 
  item for far less than what it is valued at. If there is no minumum bid and the auctioneer 
  recieves bids for that item, it must be sold to the highest bid no matter what. Or the auctioneer 
  runs the risk of being black listed. SO....good rule of thumb: Place a minimum bid on all silent 
  auctions just as you would a normal auction.<br>
  <b>8) </b>Auctioneers please dont forget to set /ignlvl to 5.  Everyone has a chance to bid on your item.<br>
  <b>9) </b>Try to refrain from posting the actually pm.  Since it is a general rule of Shimlar. Just 
  post the name of the winner, the price, and time stamp. That is all that is needed. If the auctioneer 
  posts the actual pm then they run the risk of being muted or banned.<br>
  <br>
  These are all the rules and general guidelines as of 1/22/03. The rules may change later on 
  depending on if any problems occur with the bidding and selling process. This is inteded to be a 
  fun and different way of selling an item. The mods and arches are kind enough to let us have the 
  option to do a silent auction. Lets keep it that way.
