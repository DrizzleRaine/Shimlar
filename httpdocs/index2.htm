  <title>Shimlar's end</title>
 </head>

 <body>
 Hey wow... an entirely new page...  Well it is, but it's quite possibly the last page I made for Shimlar.<br>
 It's not with pleasure I type this, more with a vague feeling of sadness, a certain level of quietness and, for the most part, 
 gratefulness.<br>
<br>
 Let's start with the bad news?  Due to the lack of funding and/or/in correlation with the lack of time I have, 
 I've decided to shut down the game.<br>
 I've made only one promise to myself when Shim started three years ago: as soon as I have to start paying, it's over.<br>
 Yups, three years ago Colosaus, father of Lord Morpheus, gave the first money ever to Shimlar.  Soon others followed, 
 with Grilak and LancelotHHS as aces.  After a while, Shintalla took over their role as best donator, not in the least 
 because he did so every month.  Raj Ahtan joined the club of what I call "superdonators", together with Gems and Death Stalker.<br>
 But alas... I can't run it depending on only a few people.  As the sources ran dry, I will have to cancel the monthly 
 serverpayment of 135$ to Dixiesys.<br>
 Last month, I had to pay half of it, this month I'll have to pay 66%.  Sorry... but I won't.
<br>
Oh I hear the questions already...<br>
<b>Ask money for stuff?</b> We never did and I never will.  Just like in the game: no begging.  If people stop donating, 
there must be some reason.<br>
<b>Yeah why did they stop?</b>  I can think of several reasons, one historical, one situated in the present.  
I'll start with the latter. <br>
Shimlar was once constructed to, as Toshax often pointed out, give Clerity a home after the demise of RaceWarKingdoms (RWK). <br>
RWK was the game most of the current admins/mods played before.  Jeff, the owner of that game, decided all of a sudden 
to stop the free game he hosted.<br>
Free?  No... there were banners to click, especially when a button was missed.  Then he started accepting donations... 
then he gave people that donated modstatus.  Then someone (DarkNecrosis) asked him: what do I get for 500$?  
That's when Jeff started thinking...<br>
Soon he started working on a new pay-to-play game, and when that was launched, the old RWK was closed and deleted.  
Toshax was number one at that moment (with a macro tsk tsk), I was number 2 (with RSI in both wrists... never really healed). <br>
All the great communities around that game (Die Altste Zunft (DAZ) and many other clan sites) were depressed... 
Toshax started using his coding skills to build a game from the ground up.<br>
Pretty soon I started coding a bit too, but placed a heavy focus on moderation and administration, as Jeff did neither of those.<br>
<b>We wanted to proof it's possible to maintain, administrate and run a game for free.</b><br>
I think we did.  But... people grow up.  Many RWK-players left Shimlar.  Many new players came... and every day, 
history became more vague.  For many people, Shimlar became just a free game.  Only the sun shines for free though.  
As it is a hobby-project, and not a side-project or advertisement, Shimlar does need money.  There are no other resources.<br>
Donations were dropping, but with the reserve from the first year, I could handle it without problems.  After a while, 
we decided to "sell" upgrades to the game.  Ah well... some were never made, some were never paid, some were never put on the page.<br>
As Shimlar drew more attention, people with bad intentions entered the game, and work rose quickly for me.  
At the time we had no rules concerning scammers and payment plans, I handled up to 70-80 mails every day.  
The last 6 months of 2003, I sent over 8000 mails.<br>
Later, macroers popped up.  While the first were quite easy to detect, the programs used became better and better.  
The last 6 months of 2004 were almost entirely spend on detecting and investigating macroers.  We ceased to release updates, 
as we wanted to secure the game first... and that's the present reason. <br>
<b>As the game stopped evolving, as in few new features, many people stopped donating.</b>  
Basically, the macroers destroyed what they wanted to obtain.  You can't be the best in a game that doesn't exists anymore.<br>
In short, in my opinion, the drop of funds is related to macroers stopping us from doing updates, and from older people leaving the game.<br>
<br>
I also have personal reasons to stop:<br>
<li>With a change of jobs, I now have 2-3 hours less free time each day.</li>
<li>I've spent every bit of free time the last three years on Shimlar, for free.</li>
<li>With the marriage upcomming, I have to plan a lot and visit lot's of places...</li>
As you might have noticed, I didn't reply to many emails after comming back from Vienna.  I also rediscovered the joy of playing games there...<br>
<br>
So... what's next?  I don't know.  I hope Rincewind will start working on Elysaria.  I might start altering the code of Shimlar, and make it more secure.  No clue.<br>
I'm terribly sorry, but concerning Shimlar, the story ends here for me.  We've had quite a few offers from external 
people to host Shimlar, but no one could guarantee us exclusive access to the filesystem.  And when someone can alter 
the database, they can alter the game.  We saw with Jeff what happens when playing favourites.  Being independent has it's price,
and everyone who can alter the game should be admin in it.<br>
<br>
Not much left for me now...  There is a huge list of people to thank.  I actually don't even know where to start.  
Admins, mods, players...  I've had so many contacts...  I can't thank you all personally.  Sorry.<br><br>
If you somehow or for some reason like to contact me: LordA@pandora.be will do.<br>
I'm currently playing a bit on WoP, www.worldofpirates.com as LordA.<br>
<br>
I will marry the 21st january 2006 for the church in Belgium, near Antwerp.  If any of you wants to be there, please tell me.  
Of course, you're welcome to the party afterwards.<br>
<br>
I will download the database to my PC, and delete it on the server.  Email addies will not be sold or something.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the fun and joy,<br>
I hope to see most of you on the web again someday.<br><br>
Koen (aka Lord ArPharazon)

<br>
Scared?  You should.  This is not a joke.<br>
I also would like to add that the source code is not for sale.  Too many people contributed to the game, and I can't repay them all.<br>
Unless someone comes up with 1000$, the price we pay for 6 months, the game will close for me the 1Oth march.  I do NOT want anyone of the people that donated lately to help in that.<br>
Shintalla, I'm talking to you.  And to you too Raj.  It saddens me to see that those who might need their money the most, are the generous people.<br> 
That's when I should pay Dixiesys... they already know I will cancel the subscription.<br>
On the other hand, free hosting might be cool too...<br>
Don't think it makes me happy to do this... for me it's like closing a chapter of my life as well.  Just like... Vano, Catrat, N'Kir Dreadnaught, Shalisa Whiteoak, Bromm, Adiekit, Trislan Silvar, Lady Selachii, Shagrath, Katrina DeGuille, Odessa, Maeva Whitecap, Toshax, Jackie and so many others...<br>
Thanks Clerity for keeping peace, J.NicoletteCanne for keeping order, Lobo and Gilian for helping me with the code, Sisco for the help with the mails and Lord Morpheus for looking after the server.<br>
Thanks to all of you too moderators, there have been quite a few over the years but you're all dear to me.<br>
Last but not least, thanks to all players, donators or not.  Shimlar couldn't have become what it was without your dedication.<br>
<br>
Thx.<br>
