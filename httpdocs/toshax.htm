<p><b><font color="#990000">Chapter I. </font></b>How it all began.
<p>A long time ago, a powerful wizard finished his education and raised
to control of a city. His name was Tauron,
<br>and his magic preference was Chaos. A small village of Dwarves was
under his command, situated somewhere
<br>in the land of Myrror. While his power grew, his armies started conquering
the nearby lands. A combination
<br>of destructive powers of fire and the battle skills of the dwarves
lead to many victories. It wasn't long that Tauron
<br>controlled most of Myrror. By conquering a mystical tower, a passage
to the world of Arcanus was discovered.
<br>While being less magical, Arcanus held four other wizards, all trying
to take control of it. By clever diplomacy
<br>and adamantium weapons the dwarven empire started spreading in this
world. However, all the wizards soon
<br>united in the fight against Tauron, but by this time he was able to
summon Great Drakes, which helped him
<br>conquer his enemies one by one. By the time only one opponent remained,
Tauron discovered the Spell of Mastery
<br>and after successful casting, which took a whole 5 years, he absorbed
all the magic the two worlds had to offer,
<br>destroying all the opposition at the same time. While some races were
annihilated, Arcanus was now densely populated
<br>with both Dwarves and Dark Elves moving from Myrror, and the natural
inhabitants, like Elves, Humans and Giants
<br>continued to grow in numbers also.
<p><b><font color="#990000">C II.</font></b> The Gate.
<p>Tauron eventually discovered a new and powerful spell. It allowed him
to travel to distant worlds, but only his
<br>spirit was allowed to pass to new worlds at will, and he could take
no magic with him. So, he sealed all the magic
<br>of the two worlds in his fortress, blocked access from Arcanus to Myrror
and decided to leave his current existence.
<br>Something went wrong.
<br>Arriving in a new place, he realized he was almost invisible, only
a shadow of himself. However, he soon discovered
<br>he could posses other beings, and even if he left the world he could
always return and take control of the person he
<br>possessed once again. At first he took a new name when he possessed
a person, but a certain power known as
<br>Commando suggested using the name Shadow, which while concealing the
true identity was close to the truth. The
<br>first appearance of Shadow was in the land of deadly combat known as
Quake. Tauron's spirit traveled to many worlds
<br>after, one of which was a highly advanced galaxy of many races. Being
a natural leader, he rose to control a whole planet
<br>of the Sakkra race. These lizard like people lived underground, and
while the true name of their planet is unknown now,
<br>it was renamed Shimlar when Shadow I was declared emperor. The Sakkra
fleet eventually took control of the whole
<br>galaxy, defeating an ancient races from Antares. The shadow spirit
moved on.
<p><b><font color="#990000">C III.</font></b> Might vs Magic.
<p>A dwarven city of Dejenol existed somewhere. Digging way too deep, the
dwarves released the Prince of Devils.
<br>Being a leader of dwarves in his first life, Shadow visited this world,
but didn't stay long. However, after this evil
<br>was defeated, another one, far greater evil plagued the lands. Shadow
always took the art of magic whether it was
<br>possible, and this was an opportunity of a lifetime. However, Shadow
was unlucky to posess an evil troll, who
<br>was too stupid for a mage, but was really fast, and made an excellent
Ninja. It was after this, that Shadow first
<br>shifted to being a fighter as well. After the dungeons were cleared,
Shadow moved to another world. This world
<br>was different from al before, in a way that souls were able to reincarnate
at will, so while still having a memory of
<br>being a mage, Shadow became a Ninja here as well, for the first time
changing his name again. The new name was
<br>Rayden,&nbsp; and this soul still exists, while not being really active.
<p><b><font color="#990000">C IV.</font></b> A new Dawn.
<p>Eventually getting bored of this world also, Shadow returned to the
lands of Dejenol, only to find that another
<br>similar existence was being formed somewhere. At this point, Shadow
briefly returned to his homeland, and
<br>selected a promising dwarf commander to test this new world for him.
Since the dwarf had no skill in magic,
<br>he didn't lose any of his knowledge, and entered this new world ready
for battle. The dwarf was called Toshax,
<br>and this name is sid to have a hidden meaning. The world was full of
poweful mages and fighters, but after a
<br>while, one person rose to power. His true name is unknown to this day,
and he is only known as Anonimus.
<br>Being a chaotically transformed dwarf, Toshax decided to beat Anonimus
and rule this and just as his master
<br>did in so many worlds. When Toshax was second in power, Shadow contacted
Commando, telling him about
<br>this new place. Commando changed the name to Chromex, and, having some
mysterious skills made it possible
<br>for his presense in this world act without him being present. Shadow
has learned one main thing from his experience
<br>as Rayden, it was efficiency. Toshax received a way to raise in power
far quicker than any of his competitors.
<br>He eventually succeeded in his plan, and, while Chromex was banished
by the God for using his powers to cheat,
<br>Toshax somehow escaped it, and even though he was not active for a
while, he was the #1 there when the
<br>world collapsed.
<p><b><font color="#990000">C V.</font></b> Return of Rayden.
<p>It seems the God became too greedy and when a new realm opened, it was
Shadow who came to it, while
<br>Toshax returned to Arcanus. Taking the name of Rayden once more, Shadow
returned to the way of the mage,
<br>and Chromex followed as well. While this new realm grew in power, it
became apparent the God has gone mad.
<br>It wasn't long before both Rayden and Chromex were banished, and it
seemed that that was it.
<p>However, Shadow noticed that being a mage once again, he has felt a
new power. He no longer needed to travel
<br>in search of new adventures, he now knew how to create them as well.
So, he returned to Myrror, and started
<br>devising his most difficult spell ever. It took almost a century, although
the time flows differently in other worlds,
<br>so it only seemed like a week to some. When he was almost ready, he
seeked Toshax the Dwarf once more, so that
<br>he could guard his fortress while Shadow was gone to get a final component
that would make the new world complete.
<p><b><font color="#990000">C VI.</font></b> Shimlar.
<p>Toshax got bored of nothing hapening and nothing to battle, since Tauron's
Fortress was protected by magic anyway,
<br>so he started to read some book. But, being a dwarf and not a magician,
he didn't realise he He was reading a book of Spells.
<br>BOOM!
<br>The world seem to grow black, then white, then black again.
<p>Toshax felt different. He was alive, but he was immortal. He was everywhere
and nowhere at the same time.
<br>He was a God.
<p>Things got worse. Every world Shadow has traveled to, was present in
a way in this one. The planet was a lot like
<br>Arcanus, but it was called Shimlar. There was admantium and morkal
magic. The wilderness became known as
<br>Outworld, yet the creatures seemed to come from a different place each.
Only a few inhabitants survived, and there
<br>was no sign of Shadow. And there was rift gates open to many of the
other worlds, and beings of great power
<br>were flowing in, their souls solidifying and taking shapes of the world's
races. So, Toshax was left with two choices,
<br>try to build this world as Shadow planed to do, or destroy it.
<p><b><font color="#990000">Epilogue.</font></b>
<p>It s not certain whether Myrror was destroyed, or if it still exists,
and if it does, whether Tauron's Fortress still stands.
<br>While it is most certain that this spell has destroyed Arcanus, trasnforming
it into Shimlar, Shadow might still live.
<br>For now, this world will be home to Toshax and any souls who decide
to stay.
