  <br>
  Q: How do i become a Mod?<br>
  A: <font color="#000000">Moderators are Chosen by Lord A and J.NicoletteCanne, after consulting other archwizards and some moderators. 
  The choice is based on their understanding of the game and general skill in handling situations in chat.</font> (Asking a Moderator, Arch Wizard or Admins 
  WILL NOT make you a Mod, it will more than likely decrease your chance.)<br>
  <br>
  Q</strong>: What Race do I choose?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: Any race you like. Check the <a href="http://www.shimlar.org/manual.htm#Races">manual</a> 
  if you want to know the details. <font color="#990000"><strong><br>
  <br>
  Q</strong>. Where am i?<br>
  </font><strong>A</strong>. All players start in their races Starting Zone.</p>
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: How do I play?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: You select a monster from a list, and click New Fight. Then 
  you either click Attack or Cast. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You get experience and gold from the creatures you 
  kill. <br>
  <strong><font color="#990000"><br>
  <strong>Q</strong>: </font></strong><font color="#990000">What happens if I 
  die?</font> <strong><br>
  <strong>A</strong>: </strong>You lose all UNBANKED gold and 20% of exp needed 
  to next level, however, exp can't go below 0. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -certain accessories can decrease the % of lost exp 
  or gold on death. (see <a href="http://www.gilians.de/shimlarguide/">God of 
  War's help site</a> accessories section)
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: Why do I only hit kobolds for 10?</font> 
  <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: This game shows the REAL damage you dealt. This means that 
  even if you did hit the monster for <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100000 damage, since it only lost 10 health, you see 
  10 damage. 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: Why are there only 10 monsters? How 
  do I get to other zones?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: When you reach a certain level, you can go to Outworld from 
  0,0 in any zone. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are over 100 monsters for sure, but each zone 
  only has a certain amount. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also teleport to other zones if you are of high 
  enough level and can afford it. 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: Outworld, huh?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: The game has a kind of world map, on which zones can be 
  found. You can go to Outworld from 0,0 once <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you reach level 15. Check the Zone Map link for a E(Exit). 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: Can I sell Spells?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: Yes. It is done in weapon Shops. 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: Can I have more than one character?</font> 
  <br>
  <strong>A</strong>:&nbsp; Yes, as many as you like. However, low level characters 
  are deleted from time to time. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not allowed to actively level two characters at 
the same time. You can be online with more than one character but are only 
allowed to level one.<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: I got item with [2]. How do I see 
  what the gem is?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: There is a function called "Examine" in the weapon Shop 
  or under the Trade menu. 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: Your mastery increased?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: You got better at using the item.<br>

  <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: 30 items max. Each item takes same space. 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: What is a Veteran/ Fanatic/ etc. 
  monster?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: There is about 6% chance for a random special monster. Some 
  have more gold, others <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have more stats, so learm what to kill and what to run from. 
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>: What characters get deleted? How 
  can I protect my mules?</font> <br>
  <strong>A</strong>: Characters below level 100 <font color="#0000FF"><b>AND</b></font> below 
10 million total gold 
  (unbanked and banked) <font color="#0000FF"><b>AND</b></font> haven't logged 
in for 30 days <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are regularly cleaned up. So log in with the mule once a 
  week or just give them over 10m gold and they <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are safe. Storing IX items and **** gems on mules is 
strongly discouraged and not recommended though, buy a house for <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those purposes, or get a character above level 100 to be 
  sure. <br>

    Q</strong>. I've bought a Spell/Weapon, but I can't equip it, not enough NTL/STR 
    or my Levels too low...why?<br>
    </font><strong>A</strong>. Exactly what it says, all items have Stat requirements, 
    if you buy them and don't have the stats you can't equip.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>. Okay, how do I find out there Stat/Level 
    requirements?<br>
    </font><strong>A</strong>. Well there are 2 ways to find out (Asking in Chat 
    isn't 1 of them, people will just tell you to do what's said below). </div>
</div>
<p>1. go to <a href="http://www.gilians.de/shimlarguide/frames/main/shimlar.htm">God of War's 
Help site</a> 
  and go to the equipment section.<br>
  2. when in the shop, select the item and click the examine button, then below 
  it will display the items info.</p>
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>. Okay I'm a Certain Race, what items 
  are best for me?<br>
  </font><strong>A</strong>. All Race info can be found at <a href="http://www.gilians.de/shimlarguide/frames/main/shimlar.htm">God of War's 
Help site</a> 
  and click on RACES.</p>
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>. Okay i just leveled what do i click 
  on?<br>
  </font><strong>A</strong>. When you first start its advisable to raise Ntl or 
  Str to equip better items as items have a Stat Requirement.</p>
<p>Weapons require STR<br>
  Spells require NTL<br>
  Armor requires VIT<br>
  <br>
  Casters should Level: (over 10 levels)</p>
<p>&middot; Wis x 5<br>
  &middot; Ntl x 3<br>
  &middot; Vit x 1</p>
<p>Fighters should Level: (over 10 levels)</p>
<p>&middot; Dex x 5<br>
  &middot; Str x 3<br>
  &middot; Vit x 1</p>
<p>This is only a rough guide, different players may have other ways, it's your 
  choice in the end.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>. I'm Level 'XXX' what should I be fighting?<br>
  </font><strong>A</strong>. Don't ask this question, each player has his/her own 
  limits, someone at level 100 may be able to kill a Druchii Guardsman in Ta'lorn 
  where other may only be able to kill a Skulking Minion, its all down to Equip 
  and Gem setup. (Instead of asking others ask yourself, can I kill a Veteran 
  and Fanatic of this type of Monster, if the answer is yes move up to the next 
  Monster).<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>. How do I heal?...and can I heal outside 
  of battle?<br>
  </font><strong>A</strong>. Yes you can heal outside of battle, but only if you 
  own a House on Estates hill. To heal in Battle you can either:</p>
<p>&middot; equip a heal spell and use that.<br>
  &middot; enchant your equip with a Ruby or Bloodrock gem&nbsp; (Ruby is best for fast 
  regeneration, but also costs more).<br>
  &middot; upgrade Ghost Armor to Mystic Armor (Saintly Plate '++') ('++' = the 
  level of the Ghost Armor).</p>
<p><strong>2. Chat Related Questions.</strong></p>
<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Q</strong>. Why do some people have bold names?<br>
  </font><strong>A</strong>. People with bold names are Archwizards. They watch 
over the game and make sure that everything runs well. Some Archwizards watch 
players to ensure that the rules are being followed, while others answer emails and
watch over the server and database.</p>

  A. </strong>* = the gems grade, the higher the grade * - ** - *** - **** the 
  most potent the gem.<br>
  <br>
  for example, <br>
  <br>
  FT* increases Armor Class (AC) by 1point.<br>
  FT**** increases Armor Class (AC) by 8points.<strong><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#993300">Q. </font></strong><font color="#993300">How do i find 
  * - **** gems</font><strong><br>
  A. </strong>Certain gem grades can only be found in certain zones, **** can 
  only be found in 2 zones, these are the best gems in the game and so are equally 
  as har to get the 2 zones are extremely hard.<strong><br>
  <br>
  </strong>Gem Pond = Level 450 to enter Level 500 - 550+ is recommended (this 
  all depends on your equip and gem setup)<br>
  Ancient Cemetary = Level 500 to enter 600 - 700 is recommended (this all depends 
  on your equip and gem setup)<br>

  item with the wrong gem (i deserve a medal for worlds biggest idiot) how do

  <br>
  Temple of Shadows found at 15,21 in The Wilderness and needs level 80 to enter. 
  (cannot enter if Alignment is +500)<br>

  A. </strong>This is tricky, they do but only in battle, they <u><strong>DO NOT</strong></u> 
  add the stat to your base stats, or physically change the value or your stats.
