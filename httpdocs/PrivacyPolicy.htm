                    <P>Shimlar logs IP addresses for systems administration 
                    and security purposes. IP addresses are logged to track a 
                    user's session and behavior.&nbsp; IP addresses are linked 
                    to player accounts which may include personally identifiable 
                    information including but not limited to e-mail 
                    addresses.&nbsp; This is necessary to maintain the integrity 
                    of our server's security, blocking both the IP addresses and 
                    disabling player accounts of problem visitors.<SPAN
